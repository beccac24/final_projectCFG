  <h3> Method:</h3>
  <ol class="method">
    <li> Add the pistachios to a food processor and pulse until finely ground. </li>
    <li> In a medium bowl, whisk together the all purpose flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Then set aside
      the
      flour mixture. </li>
    <li>Add the softened butter and granulated white sugar to a large bowl. Cream together for 2 minutes with an
      electric
      mixer. (You can also use a stand mixer fit with a paddle attachment.) </li>

    <li> Add in the buttermilk the dry ingredients a little at a time until all is added. Mix on medium-low speed
      until combined. Scrape the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula as necessary. </li>
    <li> Fold in the ground pistachios </li>

      height="200">
    <li> Pour the batter into a greased 9 x 9 baking pan lined with parchment paper. </li>
    <li> Bake the cake and then let the cake cool in the pan on a wire rack until completely cool. </li>
    <li> While the cake cools, make the cream cheese frosting. Add the butter to a large mixing bowl and mix on
      high speed with an electric mixer until pale and fluffy. Then add in the cream cheese and mix until fluffy. Sift
      in the
      powdered sugar and mix until fluffy again. (If using a stand mixer, use a whisk attachment.) </li>
    <li> Make the pistachio cream by grinding the pistachios in a food processor until they turn into pistachio
      butter. Add the pistachio butter and sweetened condensed milk to a bowl and whisk to combine. Add the heavy cream
      to
      medium bowl and beat it with an electric mixer on high speed until firm peaks form. Fold the whipped cream into
      the
      pistachio mixture. Transfer to a piping bag until ready to use. </li>
    <li> When the cake is completely cooled carefully turn the pan over to release the cake. Transfer it to a
      serving plate. Poke holes on the top of the cake using a wooden stick or the handle of a wooden spoon </li>
    <li> Pipe the pistachio cream into the holes of the cake. </li>
    <li>Frost the top of the cake with a thick layer of cream cheese frosting. Swirl pistachio cream into the
      frosting and sprinkle with chopped pistachios </li>

  <h3> <strong> Tips: </strong> </h3>
  <p> For storage <br>
    You can store this cake in an airtight container for up to 3 days. </p>
  <p> For the flavour <br>
    You can use normal cream cheese frosting if you don't want the pistachio cream filling.
    <br>
    the key to success is always measuring your ingredients properly, and make sure all your wet ingredients are in room
    temperature.

  <p> Do you recommended salted or unsalted pistachios? </p>
  <p> <strong> <i class="fa-solid fa-user-secret"></i> </i> Anonymous: </strong> </p>
  <p> Pistachio cream and cream cheese frosting was so good but my cake turned out really dry. I baked it in a round pan
    for about 35 min. </p>
  <p> <strong> <i class="fa-solid fa-user"></i> Sara: </strong> </p>
  <p>Any idea on bake time if I converted them to cupcakes? Think they would turn out nice?</p>
  <p> <strong> <i class="fa-solid fa-user"></i> John: </strong> </p>
